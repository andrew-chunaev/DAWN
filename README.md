# DAWN

DAWN is a free Java DAW 

DAWN = Frinika + DGuitar

Peter Salomonsen created a great free/open source (JAVA) Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) called Frinika which allows you to create you own music in a very intuitive way – http://www.frinika.com/

Mauricio Gracia who created DGuitar which is also a free/open source (JAVA) which allows you to open, view, and listen to Guitar Pro files – http://dguitar.sourceforge.net/

If you want to listen/share the authors music:

I have forked Frinika source code today – 24/06/2018 as a promise to understand, improve and even try to merge Frinika and DGuitar into a single great music tool

The code name for this project is DAWN (amanecer) because I hope it will be the Dawn of a new Daw Tool for the world to use, enjoy, improve and share without paying ridiculous amounts of money

If you are interested in contributing your ideas, source code, file format nowledge let me know
